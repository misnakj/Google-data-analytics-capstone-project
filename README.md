Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Project
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and focuses on the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study. As a junior data analyst within the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, I engaged in real-world tasks to address key business questions and contribute to the company's strategic decisions.

Project Overview:
In collaboration with diverse characters and team members, I followed the comprehensive data analysis processâ€”asking relevant questions, preparing the data, processing and analyzing it, and ultimately sharing actionable insights. The ultimate goal is to inform a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

Key Objectives:
Understand how casual riders and annual members utilize Cyclistic bikes differently.
Provide compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to support the marketing team's strategy recommendations.
Contribute to maximizing the number of annual memberships and ensuring the company's future success.
Project Steps:
Ask: Define key business questions and objectives.
Prepare: Acquire, clean, and structure the data for analysis.
Process: Utilize analytical techniques to explore and transform the data.
Analyze: Extract meaningful insights to inform decision-making.
Share: Communicate findings through professional data visualizations and reports.
Act: Propose data-backed recommendations for approval by Cyclistic executives.
